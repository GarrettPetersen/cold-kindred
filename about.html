        <h1>ABOUT THE GAME</h1>
        
        <p>Welcome to <strong>mystery.farm</strong>, a daily genealogical murder mystery.</p>

        <h2>THE CONCEPT</h2>
        <p>Every day at midnight, a new crime is committed on the farm. As the lead detective, your job is to reconstruct the family tree of the residents using DNA evidence and witness testimonies to identify the killer.</p>

        <h2>INSPIRATION</h2>
        <p>This game was inspired by the real-life investigation of the Golden State Killer, a serial killer who committed at least 12 murders in California between 1976 and 1986. I listened to a podcast that described how investigators found two 3rd cousins of the killer, and then traced their geneaology to a shared ancestor. Then they worked their way down the family tree from that ancestor to find the one person who could have committed the murders.</p>

        <p>My first draft of the game was a gritty, realistic murder mystery that involved flying to different cities, looking through archives of births, deaths, and marriages, and constructing a family tree through realistic detective work. But later I decided to simplify down to a simple puzzle game that could fit mostly in one screen. I grabbed the first free sprite pack I could find, which happened to be cute pixel art animals. "Why not?" I thought, and made it a cute animal murder mystery.</p>

        <h2>THE CREATOR</h2>
        <p>I am a solo developer who loves puzzle games. My first game was <a href="https://connecdoku.com">Connecdoku</a>, a word game with elements of NYT Connections and Sudoku.</p>

        <p>You can find me on X (formerly Twitter) at <a href="https://x.com/garrettpetersen">@GarrettPetersen</a>.</p>

        <p>Thank you for playing. I hope you enjoy solving today's mystery.</p>
